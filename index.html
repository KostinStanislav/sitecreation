                <img src="pics/child.jpg" width="100px"/>I was Born in Lviv,Ukraine in 1988,I had normal childhood for that time,I was eating sand,catching frogs,playing on different bilding sites with other clildren,and doing other unnormal for adults things.<br>
                After school I entered a technical college and graduated as computer system technician.I could continue to study computer systems at the Polytechnic,but just after graduation from college unexpectedly to all I decided to be an ATC and enter State Flight Academy of Ukraine. 
                <img src="pics/university.jpg" width="100px"/><br>
                <p>While studying,I was visiting millitary cathedra after lessons,and working night shifts for TNT to get some extra money.I had only 4 hours for sleeping,it was enough for me at that time. </p>
                <p>After graduation from State Flight Academy of Ukraine I was working in Aerosvit as flight attendant.It was great experience to work there.I visited many countries,in some we stayed for a couple of days,so we have opportunity to visit different interest places.And I met lots of celebrities flying by Aerosvit.</p>
                <h1>The year later,I was invited to work as an ATC in UkSatse.So,Dreams comes true!</h1>
